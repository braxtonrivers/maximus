Revision history for Maximus.

    - A Graphical User Interface has been added in the form of maximus-gui

1.0.1  2011-07-31
    - Maximus can now connect through a proxy server by adding the
      'proxyserver' setting to the configuration file. See the README file for
      more information on how to set this up.

1.0.0  2011-07-17
    - Command 'list' now sorts its output based on module (and scope) names
    - Added -verbose option to 'version' command
    - Modules were only compiled multi-threaded. Now by default Maximus will
      always compile a single-threaded and multi-threaded version. The multi-
      threaded module compilation can be skipped by specifying the -nothreaded
      argument. Before, specifying this option made the module(s) compile in
      single-threaded mode.
    - Removed command 'remove' as it isn't implemented yet
    - Updated sources specification
    - Added InnoSetup file for creating a Windows installer
    - Cleaned up chunks of unimportant commented or unused code

0.9.0  2011-06-25
    - First public beta release
