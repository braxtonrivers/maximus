Revision history for Maximus.

    - Added -verbose option to 'version' command
    - Modules were only compiled multi-threaded. Now by default Maximus will
      always compile a single-threaded and multi-threaded version. The multi-
      threaded module compilation can be skipped by specifying the -nothreaded
      argument. Before, specifying this option made the module(s) compile in
      single-threaded mode.
    - Removed command 'remove' as it isn't implemented yet
    - Updated sources specification
    - Added InnoSetup file for creating a Windows installer
    - Cleaned up chunks of unimportant commented or unused code

0.9.0  2011-06-25
