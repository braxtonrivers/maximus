JSON sources specification.
Strings in CAPS are all meant to replaced with the respective value.
'##' denotes a comment. These comments are simply for documentation purposes.
Comments are not expected in the actual json data.

NOTE: Dependencies can either be non-official modscopes/mods (e.g. duct.etc)
      or official modscopes/mods (e.g. brl.blitz). Official modscopes/mods are
      included as dependencies, but can't be served by Maximus because these
      are commercially released modules. But by mentioning these modscopes/mods
      in the sources file the client can do a full check if all dependencies
      are met.
