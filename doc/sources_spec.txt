JSON sources specification.
Strings in CAPS are all meant to replaced with the respective value.
'##' denotes a comment. These comments are simply for documentation purposes.
Comments are not expected in the actual json data.

NOTE: Dependencies are expected to be non-official modscopes/mods (we don't need to know that "blah.blah" depends on
	"brl.map", because we're only managing third-party modules).

		"MOD": {						## e.g. "logger"
			"name": "FORMAL NAME",		## e.g. "Simple message logger"
			"deps": ["MOD", "MOD", ...],	## Dependencies for the module (e.g. ["duct.etc", "duct.appendstream"])
											## This array can be absent if there are no dependencies.
