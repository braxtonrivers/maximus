JSON sources specification.
Strings in CAPS are all meant to replaced with the respective value.
'##' denotes a comment. These comments are simply for documentation purposes.
Comments are not expected in the actual json data.

NOTE: Dependencies are expected to be non-official modscopes/mods (we don't need to know that "blah.blah" depends on
	"brl.map", because we're only managing third-party modules).
